# Movie Lens Project

This repository includes the R Scripts and R Markdown file for this project.

Project Discription:

The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report in the form of an Rmd file, a report in the form of a PDF document knit from your Rmd file, and an R script that generates your predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE. Your grade for the project will be based on two factors:

Your report and script (75%)
The RMSE returned by testing your algorithm on the validation set (25%)
