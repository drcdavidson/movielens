# Movie Lens Project

This repository includes the R Scripts and R Markdown file for one of the final projects for the HarvardX Data Science: Capstone towards the Professional Certificate in Data Sciences via EdX. 

# Project Discription:

"For this project, you will be creating a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The version of movielens included in the dslabs package (which was used for some of the exercises in PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning) is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. You can find the entire latest MovieLens dataset here. You will be creating your own recommendation system using all the tools we have shown you throughout the courses in this series. We will use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier...

The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report in the form of an Rmd file, a report in the form of a PDF document knit from your Rmd file, and an R script that generates your predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE. Your grade for the project will be based on two factors:

Your report and script (75%)
The RMSE returned by testing your algorithm on the validation set (25%)"
